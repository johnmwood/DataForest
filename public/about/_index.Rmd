```{r include = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(magick)
"print.magick-image" <- function(x, ...){
  ext <- ifelse(length(x), tolower(image_info(x[1])$format), "gif")
  tmp <- tempfile(fileext = paste0(".", ext))
  image_write(x, path = tmp)
  knitr::include_graphics(tmp)
}
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Bringing real solutions to business problems drives me to succeed and continue to learn. I'm looking to find full-time work with problems which challenge my critical thinking, push me to learn every day, and bring true value to the organization. 

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align = "left", out.width = "50%"}
library(magick)
library(magrittr) 

profile_picture <- image_read("img/me.png") %>%
  image_scale("400") %>%
  image_scale("x400") %>%
  image_border("#f4f4f4", "10x10") 

image_write(profile_picture, path = "img/me2.jpg", format = "jpg")
knitr::include_graphics("img/me2.jpg")
```
